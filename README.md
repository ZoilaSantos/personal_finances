# Personal Finances from August 2023 - March 2024

Inspiration: The majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and I wanted to track my finances to see where I fall on the spectrum of financial ruin to financially okay. I also wanted the opportunity to analyze and create visualizations on this data so I could very clearly see where my money is going.

Data Source: My personal finances that I have tracked in an Excel Spreadsheet for the past 8 months and then imported into SSMS. 

Analysis: SQL
